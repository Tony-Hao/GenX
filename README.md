GenX : A Method for Structuring Transgender Eligibility Criteria Text 



Objectives: To develop an automated approach to structuring transgender criteria texts for enhancing transgender-related clinical trial recruitment.


Materials and Methods: A virtual population gender architecturedata model incorporating transgender population is designed and an automated method called GenX is developed. GenX identifies transgender features from clinical trial texts and concludes verifies final gender specification in the architecturedata model. GenX is compared to 43 machine learning methods on 3 evaluation metrics for it performance on 105,078 clinical trials obtained from The ClinicalTrials.gov as of 2017/03/22.



Results: GenX achieves a macro-averaged precision of 0.82, a macro-averaged recall of 0.823 and a macro-averaged F1-measure of 0.821, outperforming all other 43 baseline methods . The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GenX in transgender criteria extraction .
