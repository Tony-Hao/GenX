NCT01723384,male,Intermittent Naltrexone Among Polysubstance Users,"Naltrexone, a -opioid receptor antagonist, is a promising agent for methamphetamine-using and binge-drinking men who have sex with men (MSM). Naltrexone has shown efficacy in reducing relapse to amphetamines and is FDA-approved for alcohol dependence. Oral naltrexone is inexpensive and has few toxicities but the standard daily regimen for naltrexone is problematic as patients forget to take the medication. Given the challenges in daily dosing, alternate regimen schedules have been proposed to increase efficacy and expand the population that may benefit from this pharmacologic agent. One approach is intermittent targeted administration of naltrexone, whereby individuals take the medication as-needed in anticipation of substance use or during periods of craving. Administration of naltrexone prior to exposure to amphetamines significantly attenuates craving and targeted naltrexone has shown efficacy in reducing heavy alcohol use. However, there have been no studies assessing intermittent targeted dosing of naltrexone among methamphetamine-using and binge-drinking MSM. Polysubstance use patterns are common among MSM, and studies among those who abuse more than one substance are urgently needed.

NCT02119377,both,First Australian National Trans Mental Health Study,"This is an Internet-based survey of transgender and transsexual (trans) people aged 18 years and older living in Australia. This population has received limited attention from public health researchers, planners, and practitioners. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that trans people experience disparities in several important areas of health compared with the population generally. In particular, trans people are more likely to experience mental health problems (notably depression and anxiety disorders), use alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, and think about or attempt suicide. Additionally, trans people commonly report that their physical and mental health needs are not met, and underutilise preventive health care.# Participants were recruited using several non-probability sampling techniques, (including purposive sampling and snowball sampling), because random sampling is not possible with this population. Medical, social, support, and advocacy networks used by trans people were used to promote the study. A mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology was used. Validated quantitative instruments were used to obtain measures of health and well-being, which will be compared against population norms. Qualitative items complement these measures, providing rich experiential data.# The investigators hypothesised that:# - the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders will be higher than for the population generally, and that these conditions will commonly be undiagnosed and untreated;# - depressive and anxiety disorders will be associated with risky behaviours, such as tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use; and,# - trans people will report poor relationships with medical practitioners.# The investigators hypothesised that poor mental health is a consequence of several interrelated factors: body dysphoria (as a consequence of experiencing difficulty accessing medical treatment to alter sexual characteristics); societal discrimination and stigma (including harassment and violence); institutionalised discrimination (including difficulty changing identifying documents, and exclusion of surgical procedures and related treatments from public and private health systems); social isolation; and the belief held by many clinicians that transsexualism is a mental disorder (which may be a barrier to trans people forming trusting relationships with medical practitioners).",,Inclusion Criteria:# - Live in Australia# - Self-identify as trans# Exclusion Criteria:# - Aged less than 18 years
NCT02185274,both,Observational Study on Metabolism and Psychopathology in Transsexual Patients,"Gender identity disorders (also known as transsexualism) is defined as a condition in which a person with apparently normal somatic sexual differentiation is convinced that he or she is actually a member of the other sex. Most patients therefore undergo so called cross-sex hormone treatment. Treatment protocols follow international consensus statements but vary considerably between different centres and countries since no prospective and controlled trials are available on this subject and recommendations are mainly based on retrospective data analysis and experience of the individual centres. Applying high doses of testosterone to biological females and vice versa high doses of estradiol to biological males definitely impacts myriads of body functions, from which it has to be assumed that only a minority has already been elucidated so far. Especially in male-to-female-transsexuals there seems to be an increased risk for the development of mood disorders and cardiometabolic comorbidities.

While surgery, clothing and hair for example, can help a person appear more like a male, many transgender males will want to take testosterone to make them feel and look more masculine.# This usually involves injecting testosterone into a muscle every 1-2 weeks for many years. Intramuscular injections can often be uncomfortable or painful, and requires the patient to be taught how to inject themselves. Or somebody else has to do it. There is a growing trend in some transgender men to give their injection just below the skin or subcutaneously (like insulin in a diabetic), because it is less uncomfortable but we don't really know if testosterone gets into the blood in the same way. At least one clinic in the US already suggests that patients can use the subcutaneous method but there is almost no research to show it's the same as intramuscular.# Our project will be looking at a small group of transgender males who are already on intramuscular testosterone and then switch them over to the same dose of subcutaneous testosterone, and then compare their levels of testosterone. If those levels are similar, then patients may chose the less uncomfortable subcutaneous injection.",,Inclusion Criteria:# - Transgender males or identifying along the male spectrum# - Currently on stable doses of weekly IM testosterone# - Using either Testosterone cypionate or enanthate# - Between 19-59 years old# - Stable doses of regular medications# - Receive their transgender care from one of five(5) Vancouver-based physicians who specialize in transgender care (Three Bridges or Raven Song Community Health Centres).# Exclusion Criteria:# - Medically or psychiatrically unstable# - Recent or imminent surgery (6-8 weeks) that has or may affect testosterone dosage# - Unable to present for nine(9) weeks of weekly blood work and two(2) weeks of alternate day blood work

In order to be effective, PrEP-based prevention strategies need to address not only biological efficacy, but also individual behavioral decision-making processes, interpersonal partnership contexts of risk, peer norms of sexual behavior and PrEP adherence, and structural access to prevention technologies. Using a health promotion behavioral model that combines Social Action Theory with social network theories of information dissemination and collective behavior change, the investigators propose to develop and refine a network-based intervention that promotes PrEP adherence in the existing social networks of TW. Formative research will outline individual, partner-level, and network-based contexts of sexual risk behavior, patterns of social network interactions, anticipated adoption and use of new prevention technologies, and optimal content for a PrEP adherence intervention.

NCT02715232,both,Effects of Sex Steroids on the Serotonin System,"Background Sex hormones such as estradiol and testosterone modulate human brain structure and function and are tightly connected to neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders. Using molecular imaging in humans in vivo, the investigators showed strong influences of sex hormones on serotonergic neurotransmission via modulation of serotonergic receptors and transporters. Although, animal studies also indicate strong modulatory influences on serotonin synthesis and degradation, human data on this potential effect are absent.# Objectives of the study The aim of this study is to prove the modulatory influence of sex hormones on serotonergic neurotransmission by determining the enzymatic processes involved in serotonin synthesis and degradation using positron emission tomography (PET) in humans in vivo with the radiotracers [11C]AMT and [11C]harmine.# Study design Single-blind, longitudinal study. Transsexuals will undergo four PET and two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements: 1. One [11C]AMT PET, one [11C]harmine PET and one MRI measurement before start of treatment, 2. One [11C]AMT PET, one [11C]harmine PET and one MRI measurement after 4 months of treatment. The investigators propose an overall study duration of 36 months.# Materials and Methods:# PET measurements will be performed on a GE Advance PET scanner. To examine the interdependence between serotonin activity and brain structure and function, four MRI sequences will be performed in order to assess gray matter volume and cortical thickness, gray and white matter microstructure, as well as resting state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow. MRI measurements will be done on a 3 Tesla scanner with high spatial and temporal resolution.# Study population 20 healthy female-to-male (FtM), 20 healthy male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals (aged 18-50) who are free of hormone-medication at baseline; 40 healthy controls, matched for sex, age and education level.# Relevance and implications of the study This will be the first imaging study to investigate the effects of high-dose, long-term opposite-sex steroid hormones on serotonin synthesis and degradation in the living human brain using PET. The study will lead to the establishment of a comprehensive theory of serotonergic modulation by sex steroids and will increase knowledge on the serotonergic role in shaping brain morphology, microstructure and structural/functional connectivity. Results will provide essential data for a better understanding of neural sex differences associated with differences in hormonal states in humans and will elucidate neurobiological correlates of the known gender difference in the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders, thus contributing to the development of personalized treatment, the reduction of personal suffering and the reduction of costs and occupational disability.",,"Inclusion Criteria:# - DSM-5 diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria (DSM-5: 302.85; ICD-10: F64.1) (for transsexuals only)# - Somatic health based on history, physical examination, ECG, laboratory screening, SCID# - willingness and competence to sign the informed consent form# Exclusion Criteria:# - concomitant major medical or neurological illness# - internal or neurologic medical histories as well as pregnancy (positive urine pregnancy test) or breastfeeding# - other DSM-5 Axis-I comorbidities, determined by a structured clinical interview (SCID), especially body dysphoric disorder (DSM-5: 300.7; ICD-10: F45.22), schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders# - steroid hormone treatment within 6 months prior to inclusion# - treatment with psychotropic agents such as SSRIs# - any implant or stainless steel graft# - abnormal values in routine laboratory screening or general physical examination# - current substance abuse or current or past substance related disorder# - for participants who participated in an earlier neuroimaging study using ionizing radiation, the total radiation exposure dose of 20 mSv over the last 10 years must not be exceeded, as specified in the legislation on radiation protection (Allg.

      sufficient for extrapulmonary tuberculosis except for bone tuberculosis and tubercular
      meningitis. Despite these recommendations, most physicians treating abdominal tuberculosis
      use antituberculous therapy for 9 months, sometimes even 12 months without any scientific

      difference in success rate of 6mo (99%) vs 12 months (94%) antituberculous drugs

      motivational interviewing (MI) on promoting home-based walking therapy to improve walking
      ability in African Americans with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). African Americans are
      more than two times as likely as non-Hispanic whites to suffer from PAD. For patients with
      PAD, there is a significant risk for poor walking ability and limb loss. One major treatment
      for PAD is walking therapy but the traditional methods for the delivery of this treatment
      have required frequent visits to a university or hospital-based site. The investigators will
      address the role of self-managed walking program, to be conducted at or near the home, to
      improve limb function. In order to motivate the participants to walk, the investigators
      included two different intervention strategies: MI and patient-centered counseling for
      exercise (PACE). The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to the MI arm
      will have a greater increase in their walking distance, compared to those receiving
      Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE) and the control group.","","Inclusion Criteria:#          1. African American (determined by self-report)#          2.

Currently walking for exercise at least 5 days per week (i.e., a PACE score ranging             from 5-8); the rationale is that a person who is currently walking for at least 5             days per week is already sufficiently active and therefore not a member of the target             population for our motivational home-based walking intervention.#          2. Prior major amputation (foot or lower leg) or critical leg ischemia (tissue loss,             gangrene, or ulcers)#          3. Rest pain with ABI <0.4 and non-palpable femoral pulses without prior evaluation by a             vascular surgeon, given the need for evaluation for the role of more invasive therapy             prior to recommending walking therapy#          4. Leg revascularization within 3 months of enrollment or plans for revascularization             during the study period; the rationale is that post intervention recovery and             potential complications are likely to limit the patient's ability to adhere to the             study protocol.#          5. Use of supplemental oxygen; the rationale for this is concern for participant safety             and potential limited ability to participate in the study secondary to breathing             difficulty.#          6. Myocardial infarction within the preceding 3 months; the rationale for this is             participant safety and the potential risk for complications and/or the need for             supervised cardiac rehabilitation following the event.#          7. Resting blood pressure > 200/110 mmHg; the rationale for this is participant safety,             as blood pressure may further increase during exercise and increase risk for a             cerebrovascular event or myocardial infarction.#          8. Exercise-induced coronary ischemic symptoms, or exercise-induced ST depression > 2.0             mm; the rationale for this is participant safety and the need for further cardiac             evaluation prior to involvement in walking therapy (American College of             Cardiology/American Heart Association, 2006).#          9. Inability to walk for 2 minutes; the rationale being that people who cannot walk for             2 minutes would not be able to complete the necessary submaximal treadmill test,             which is used to screen for coronary ischemic symptoms. We will also exclude anyone             who can walk for 20 minutes or more during the submaximal treadmill test. Anyone who             can complete the submaximal test would not have significant walking impairment and             would not get that much out of the study. Short Physical Performance Battery score of             10 or higher as such persons do not have a clinically significant impairment in             mobility; therefore, we will exclude anyone who scores a 10 or higher (out of a             maximum of 12 points)."

      Many cancer patients use counseling or other resources to help with the emotional burden of
      their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving them a place to
      express their feelings. ""Meaning-Centered"" counseling aims to teach cancer patients how to
      maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives, despite cancer.
      ""Supportive"" counseling is intended to help the patient cope with cancer by giving them a
      place to express their feelings and get support. Enhanced Usual Care is intended to offer

      research team to evaluate the implementation of an integrated and interdisciplinary primary
      care network for prevention and management of cardiometabolic risks (diabetes and
      hypertension) (PCR). The intervention is based on the Chronic Care Model and the development
      of an integrated services network. PCR is to be implemented in 6 territories of ""Centre de
      sant et de services sociaux (CSSS)"". A first application for funding was made to Fonds
      Pfizer-FRSQ-MSSS for an evaluation that has to be completed in the first 24 month after the
      beginning of the implementation. This application to the PHSI program at CIHR is
      complementary and will ensure an evaluation of the sustainability of PCR and of long term
      effects (40 months after the beginning of the implementation) for patients and for their
      primary care physicians.

      In each CSSS, PCR plans for : 1- an interdisciplinary team in an education center working
      with primary care physicians and offering to referred  patients a pre-determined sequence of
      clinical interventions over a 2-year-period; 2- a program supporting primary care physicians
      (continuing education, documentation and clinical guidelines, referral system to second line
      of care); 3- networking between actors of ""Rseau local de services (RLS)"" insuring clinical
      information transfer required for efficient patient management.

      OBJECTIVES: 1-evaluate PCR effects according to territory, time and degree of exposure
      (specifically benefits to registered patients and support to participating primary care
      physicians); 2- identify the degree of implementation of PCR in each CSSS territory and the
      related contextual factors; 3- examine the relationship between the effects identified, the
      degree of implementation of PCR and the related contextual factors; 4- assess the impact of
      implementing PCR on the strengthening of RLS.

      METHODS: The proposed evaluation will be done through a mixed design including two
      complementary strategies. Using a ""quasi-experiment/before-after"" design, the first strategy
      is a quantitative approach looking at the program effects and their variation between
      territories. This analysis will use data from the PCR clinical database (ex.: HbA1c, BP,
      lifestyle) and from patient questionnaire inquiring about care experience, utilization of
      services, chronic care follow-up, self-management and quality of life. Around 3000 patients
      will be enlisted. A primary care physician questionnaire will enquire about PCR effects on
      their practice. Using primarily a qualitative and a case study approach, each of the 6
      territories being one case, the second strategy will identify the degree of implementation
      of PCR and the explanatory contextual factors. This analysis with use data obtained from
      semi-structured interviews with program managers. The results of this analysis will be
      summarized in a monograph for each territory. According to the type of indicator analyzed,
      objective 3 will be fulfilled using linear models or longitudinal multilevel models
      supplemented with an interpretive approach using the information from monographs and
      discussion groups. The impact of implementing PCR on RLS will be assessed through interviews
      with key informants.

      RESULTS AND EXPECTED IMPACT: Our study will identify the effectiveness of PCR and contextual
      factors associated with successful implementation and sustainability of PCR. Detailed
      contextual information will allow application of our results to other environments that have
      similar context and to other chronic conditions that could benefit from an integrated
      services network.

      KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER: Since decision makers, clinicians and researchers did and will take part
      in all phases of PRC evaluation (planning, data collection, analysis and interpretation),
      diffusion of information regarding the program is an integral part of the research process.
      In addition, results will be presented at local, regional, provincial and national
      conferences and published in reports and articles widely distributed. More specifically, a
      regional symposium will be organized to share evaluation results with all CSSS in the region

      main omega-3s (alpha-linolenic acid: ALA, 18:3n-3; eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA; 20:5n-3;
      docosahexaenoic acid: DHA, 22:6n-3), DHA and EPA have been studied extensively and have been
      shown to be important in brain function. Conversely, little is known about the effects of
      ALA even though the body can make DHA and EPA from it. Because the rate at which ALA makes
      DHA and EPA is very slow, ALA is not considered an important source of DHA and EPA. However,
      in the human diet, ALA is more readily available, more easily consumed, and less expensive
      relative to animal sources of DHA and EPA. So, it is very important that the investigators
      explore the effects of supplementation with ALA. It is possible that the ALA to DHA and EPA
      conversion rate can be altered by methylation, an epigenetic form of gene expression and
      regulation. In the present study, the investigators will examine memory abilities and
      genetic baselines in 16-month-olds. The investigators will then supplement their food with
      ALA or control oil for 4 months. At 20 months, the investigators will collect outcome data
      on memory, fatty acid status, genetic variations, and methylation. The investigators
      hypothesize that the ALA supplementation will result in an increase in the rate of ALA to
      DHA and EPA conversion through methylation and genetic variations and subsequently, memory
      abilities will improve.

      may be protective against atherosclerosis. However, statins may have an effect on ery-apoB.

      Objective: to investigate the effect of statins on ery-apoB levels.

      Study design: a non-randomized intervention study. Ery-apoB will be measured twice in
      volunteers who are on statin therapy for medical reasons. After a baseline measurement of
      ery-apoB volunteers will discontinue their statin use for a period of six weeks followed by
      a second measurement of ery-apoB. Consecutively subjects will start with their original
      statin therapy again.

      Study population: patients on statin therapy aged 18 years or older.

      Intervention: temporary discontinuation of statin therapy for a period of six weeks.

      Main study endpoints: changes in ery-apoB levels.

      twice, the second visit will be exactly six weeks after the first visit. The volunteers'
      general practitioner and medical specialist (internist or cardiologist) will be informed

"NCT01659814","both","Dopamine Neurotransmission in Major Depression","The overall aim of this study is to utilize an integrative research model in order to
      dynamically assess reward-related dopamine (DA) transmission in major depressive disorder
      (MDD) and test the role of dysfunctional DA release in depression and anhedonia.

      The first arm of this line of research (PET scan) aims to investigate phasic DA release in
      MDD during incentive motivation.  The investigators will utilize an established molecular
      imaging technique to measure striatal DA release dynamically during performance of testing
      and control versions of a monetary incentive delay task, which involves anticipation and
      receipt of monetary rewards.  In doing so, this experiment will link together independent
      lines of research that have associated depression with decreased hedonic responsiveness,
      impaired reinforcement learning and dysfunctional DA transmission. We hypothesize that,
      relative to matched controls, unmedicated MDD subjects will show reduced reward-related
      ligand (11C-raclopride) displacement. Reduced ligand displacement will be interpreted as
      indicating reduced task-induced release of endogenous striatal DA in response to
      reward-predicting cues and unpredictable reward in MDD subjects.

      In the second arm of this research (EEG recording), the investigators aim to probe the
      spatio-temporal dynamics of brain mechanisms underlying positive and negative reinforcement
      learning in MDD and their relations to phasic DA. Participants will perform the
      probabilistic stimulus selection task (PSST) while event-related potentials (ERPs) are
      collected. The investigators expect that, relative to matched controls, unmedicated MDD
      subjects will show reduced positive reinforcement learning, potentiated negative
      reinforcement learning, and larger (i.e., more negative) feedback-related negativity (FRN)
      in response to positive reinforcement (indicative of reduced DA transmission). Moreover, the
      investigators hypothesize that a more negative FRN in response to positive reinforcement
      will be associated with decreased striatal raclopride displacement (i.e., lower release of
      endogenous DA) as measured by PET in the first part of the study. This experiment will
      investigate the effects of blunted DA transmission on behavioral and ERP markers of both
      positive and negative reinforcement learning.","Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder and Healthy Controls","Inclusion Criteria:#          -  Both genders and all ethnic origins, age between 18 and 45;#          -  Written informed consent;#          -  Right-handed (Chapman and Chapman 1987);#          -  Absence of serious or unstable medical illness, including cardiovascular, hepatic,             renal, respiratory, endocrine, neurologic or hematologic disease;#          -  Absence of history of seizure disorder;#          -  Absence of history of current diagnosis of any of the following DSM-IV psychiatric             illnesses:      organic mental disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,             delusional disorder, psychotic          disorders not otherwise specified, bipolar             disorder, patients with mood congruent or mood incongruent psychotic features,             substance dependence, substance abuse within the last 12 months     (with the             exception of cocaine or stimulant abuse; which will lead to exclusion), as assessed             by subject history and a structured clinical interview (SCID-I/NP);#          -  Absence of history of cocaine or stimulant use (e.g., amphetamine, cocaine,             methamphetamine);#          -  Absence of history of use of dopaminergic drugs (including methylphenidate);#          -  Absence of current use of other psychotropic drugs#          -  Absence of substance dependence or substance abuse in the last 12 months;#          -  Absence of history or current diagnosis of dementia, or a score greater than 26 on             the Mini Mental Status Examination (Folstein, 1975) at the screening visit;#          -  Absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism;#          -  Absence of neurological illness#        Specific exclusion criteria for PET scan are as follows:#          -  Pregnant women, women trying to get pregnant, or women of childbearing potential who             are not using a medically accepted means of contraception (defined as implant,             condom, diaphragm, spermicide, IUD, s/p tubal ligation, partner with vasectomy).#          -  Failure to meet standard PET safety requirements.#        Specific inclusion criteria for depressed participants are as follows:#          -  DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for MDD melancholia subtype (diagnosed with the use of the             SCID) or MDD with anhedonia (score of 3 or greater on the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure             Scale (SHPS));#          -  A baseline HRSD score (Hamilton 1960) greater than or equal to 16 (17-item version);#          -  Absence of suicidal ideation where outpatient treatment is determined unsafe by the             study clinician.

Current therapeutic options include corticosteroids alone or in combination with alkylating agents, cyclosporin A, and mycophenolate mofetil. The most widely recognized, and best-validated regimen is combination therapy with corticosteroids and an alkylating agent, but its use is associated with significant adverse effects. Recent meta-analysis confirmed that present day treatments are far from ideal 6 Thus, it should not come as a surprise that the outcome of MN has not substantially improved over the past 30 years, and up to 40% of patients still progress to end-stage renal failure. 7 Like in other glomerular diseases the amount of protein in the urine correlates well with long term prognosis. Thus, this parameter has been used in previous studies, and will be used in this study, as the primary indicator of effectiveness of therapy. We proposed to do a pilot study to test the hypothesis that selective B lymphocyte depletion will result in disappearance of pathogenic antibodies and induction of remission of the nephrotic syndrome in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Our population will be 10 adults. The study will be conducted between our Nephrology Divisions at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Jacksonville, and Scottsdale. We will enroll patients with a GFR 25 ml/min as estimated by creatinine clearance and proteinuria > 4g/24h, while receiving an ACEI or ARB and with BP controlled of < 130/80 mmHg. Patients will receive Rituximab 1g on Day 1 and 15. Patients followed for 1 years following completion of treatment. The primary outcome will be change in urinary protein excretion at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be changes in serum albumin, serum lipid?s profile, the number of partial remissions, time to remission, and incidence of relapses. We will also perform a pharmacokinetic study to evaluate the effect of proteinuria on the bio-availability and effects of the drug.","","Patients must meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for study entry:# - Membranous Nephropathy with diagnostic biopsy performed within the last 3 years. Renal biopsy slides and electron photomicrographs will be reviewed by study investigators, and must confirm a diagnosis of MN.# - Age &#61619; 18 years.# - Proteinuria as measured via Uprot/UCr ratio > 4.0 on a spot sample of a 24-hour urine collection, despite ACE inhibitor / ARB treatment. The choice of urine protein/creatinine ratios is in accord with recently developed National Kidney Foundation Chronic Kidney Disease (NKF-CKD) guidelines.107 The NKF-CKD guidelines advocate urine protein/creatinine ratios as the preferred method for evaluation of urinary protein excretion in both adults and children.# - Patients need to be treated with an ACEI and/or ARB, for at least 3 months prior to enrollment with adequately controlled blood pressure (BP <140/80 mm Hg in >75% of the readings).# - Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or practicing a medically approved method of contraception.# - Patients with thromboembolic complications and/or clinical signs of NS that are not controlled with conventional medical treatment will enter the immunosuppressive portion of the protocol (Rituxan treatment) without the 3 months of ACE/ARB treatment (high risk patients).# - Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of the study protocol# - Adequate renal function as indicated by estimated GFR &#8805; 25 ml/min per 1.73m2 and/or or serum creatinine <4.0 mg/dL in the presence of ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy. The GFR will be estimated using the 4 variable MDRD equation as published in the NKF-CKD guidelines. The same NKF-CKD guidelines also promote the use of estimated GFR (GFRest) values rather than serum creatinine levels or creatinine clearance measurements as the preferred non-invasive method of determining glomerular filtration rates.107 We have opted to use this approach rather than the much more expensive and more invasive techniques that employ clearance measurements of exogenous substances (such as inulin or iothalamate) since the likelihood of detecting significant changes in GFR in this short term study is remote - no matter which method is chosen. The inclusion of and/or serum creatinine <4.0 mg/dL is to cover possibility of incomplete 24-hour collection at time baseline creatinine clearance.)# - Adequate liver function, as indicated by bilirubin, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels (up to < 2.5 times the upper normal limit).# - Negative serum pregnancy test (for women of child bearing age)# - Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during treatment and for twelve months (1 year) after completion of treatment or a period of 21 months for those undergoing retreatment."
"NCT01453062","all","Phase IV Observational Study in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia","B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a subtype of mature peripheral B-cell neoplasms, characterized by the accumulation of circulating malignant lymphocytes that typically express cell surface markers CD5, CD20, and CD23. It is the most common type of leukemia in adults in Western Europe and in the US. The median age at diagnosis is 65-70 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Initially, most patients present with asymptomatic lymphocytosis and do not need cytoreductive therapy. Patients with active disease are characterized by a lymphocyte doubling time of less than 6 months, or progressive, even massive lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss, and extreme fatigue are common in advanced disease and can significantly impact quality of life. CLL also causes relative immunosuppression that increases the risk of infections that are ultimately the major cause of death in this patient population. Median survival at diagnosis ranges from 5 to 20+ years depending on risk factors, but is only 6 to 14 months for patients with CLL refractory to available therapies.# Arzerra (ofatumumab) is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds specifically to a distinct epitope encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The CD20 molecule is a transmembrane phosphoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes from the pre-B to mature B lymphocyte stage and on B-cell tumors.# Arzerra is designated as an orphan medicinal product in the European Union (EU) for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) concluded that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was estimated to be affecting approximately 3.5 in 10,000 persons in the Community at the time the application was made (June 2008) and that the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to poor long-term survival in high-risk patients.# Arzerra was given a conditional approval in the EU on April 19, 2010. The approved indication in the EU for the product is treatment of CLL in patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. A specific obligation for this conditional approval was an agreement by GSK to conduct a post-marketing observational study in CLL patients receiving Arzerra. The data from this study is intended to enhance the evidence of the safety and efficacy of Arzerra as it is used in clinical practice, and once final data are available, together with results of a second specific obligation study, will support the transition from conditional to a full approval of Arzerra in the EU.# The objective of this observational study is to provide additional data to confirm the safety profile and efficacy of Arzerra for CLL patients treated in clinical practice.# Particular data of interest are: co-morbidities (specific chronic disease diagnoses), concomitant medications, disease (CLL) characteristics, prior treatment regimens, adverse events, reasons for discontinuation of Arzerra therapy, Arzerra response, progression free survival, and overall survival.# This is an observational, non-interventional, medical record review study in CLL patients. A total of 100 patients with CLL who have previously received Arzerra, whether alive or deceased, and have either completed the full course of Arzerra therapy or discontinued treatment early will be eligible to participate in the study. Centers across Europe who are members and non members of the European Research Initiative of CLL (ERIC) and treat CLL patients will participate in the study.# CLL patients newly initiating Arzerra who are still undergoing the treatment phase and patients having been treated with Arzerra in phase II or phase III clinical trials will be excluded.# For patients who have completed approximately 1 year or more of follow up since Arzerra initiation, data on response to Arzerra, adverse events during treatment and subsequent to treatment, patient status, progression free survival and overall survival covering the period up to approximately one-year post-drug initiation will be collected. For patients who have not completed approximately l year of follow-up since Arzerra initiation, including those who have been lost to follow up or died prior to one year or have not yet had a full year to elapse in calendar time, similar data will be collected at the point in time at the last available patient contact with the physician using information in the record. After approach for informed consent from the patient or next of kin for patients who have died to review the medical record, no interaction with the patient will occur.","","Inclusion Criteria:# - All CLL patients who have previously received Arzerra, whether alive or deceased# - Patients who have either completed the full course of Arzerra therapy or discontinued treatment early# Exclusion Criteria:# - CLL patients newly initiating Arzerra# - Patients having been treated with Arzerra in phase II or phase III clinical trials"
"NCT01599533","all","Screening for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Among a Cohort of Patients With a Degenerative Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm","Many publications deal with the natural history of aortic aneurysms in literature. Except for connective tissue disorders as Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome, aortic aneurysms are a complex multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental risk factors. Susceptibility loci identified in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) do not overlap, suggesting that different genetic risk factors contribute to these two forms of aneuryms. With a higher prevalence correlated to ageing (5%), AAA is usually presented as the degenerative form of the disease. However, a recent epidemiologic study by Olsson et al. has revealed an increasing incidence of thoracic aortic disease among older individuals (70+/-12 years) with 60% of aneurysmal rupture or dissection at diagnosis, and a 1.7 :1 male-to-female ratio compared to 6:1 in AAA. From this current knowledge arises the concept of diffuse or plurisegmental degenerative aneurysmal aortic disease, poorly explored so far. As regards to the prevention policy, there is a consensus statement in which ultrasonography screening for AAA is recommended for all individuals aged > 60 years (particularly in men who have ever smoked) and for those aged > 50 years with family history of AAA. Nevertheless, screening for a concomittant thoracic location of the disease (except thoracoabdominal aneurysm) is not yet required, whereas it could change the prognosis of the patients and influence their management.","","Inclusion Criteria:# - Major subject at the time of the inclusion# - Subject sent in hospitalization or in consultation of surgery vascular for coverage of the first one anvrysme of the sub-renal abdominal aorta degenerative, without anomaly associated by the coeliac aorta, and by the upper diameter in 40mm (according to the criteria of measure recommended for the analysis in echography doppler or in angioscanner).# - subject not presenting contraindication to the realization of the diagnostic examination by aortic angioscanner# - Subject having signed a consent.# Exclusion Criteria:# Subject under age 18# - pregnant Woman# - Subject received in the phase aigue of a break or a fissuring of an AAA under renal# - Subject already operated for a thoracic or abdominal aortic anvrysme# - Subject presenting at least one of the following pathologies:# - heart disorder valvulaire aortic: aortic incapacity of rank superior to 2, tight aortic stenosis, prosthesis valvulaire aortic# - context of bicuspidie station wagon diagnosed on at least 2 parents of the first degree# - of a not degenerative aortopathie anvrysmale bound(connected) in bicuspidie aortic, or: A dissection of type(chap) A or of type(chap) B# - Of a degenerative aortopathie of type anvrysme thoracoabdominal (in particular, affected by the coeliac aorta, defined by the segment enter the diaphragmatique crossing and the renal arteries)"

The HIV epidemic in Peru remains concentrated within the core risk group of MSM. STI infection and re-infection are central to the continuation of the HIV epidemic among MSM in Peru. Development of improved strategies for partner notification and treatment will reduce the incidence and prevalence of STIs and ultimately reduce the incidence of HIV infection in this population. The first phase of this study used qualitative methods to explore attitudes and practices related to partner notification among MSM in Lima, Peru. Findings from the qualitative research were used to develop a quantitative survey instrument to assess partner notification decision-making processes and practices among MSM in Peru recently diagnosed with HIV or syphilis infection. Data from both quantitative and qualitative phases of the study have been used to develop a partner notification for MSM in Peru. Investigators plan to implement and assess the impact of the intervention on rates of partner notification following a diagnosis of syphilis among MSM in Lima, Peru.

"NCT02458365","all","A Stage-Based Expert System for Teen Dating Violence Prevention","Male-to-female intimate partner violence accounts for 26% of violence-related injuries in women presenting in hospital emergency departments and 33% of all female homicides. Adolescence provides an excellent ""window of opportunity"" for the prevention of intimate partner violence. Patterns of relating in intimate relationships are still relatively undifferentiated and open to influence. However, the evidence supporting traditional, school-based programs for the prevention of teen dating violence is mixed. A major problem with existing programs is that they are ""one size fits all,"" making it difficult to meet the diverse needs of students-boys and girls, individuals who are dating and those who are not, individuals who have experienced dating violence as a victim, perpetrator, or both, and those who have not. Perhaps most importantly, these interventions neglect individual differences in readiness to use healthy, non-violent ways of relating to stay violence-free. In Phase I the objective was to use expert system technology to integrate best practices for teen dating violence prevention with the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM), the ""stage model,"" to develop an interactive, multimedia computer-administered change program that delivers individualized intervention sessions and exercises tailored to stage of change and other individual characteristics. In Phase II, the objective was to complete development of the intervention package and assess its efficacy in a randomized clinical trial involving 3,901 teens from 20 Rhode Island high schools randomly assigned to intervention or comparison. Among youth exposed to risk for dating violence, efficacy was assessed by comparing the intervention and comparison groups on dating violence perpetration and victimization at follow-up. Among youth not exposed to risk for dating violence, efficacy was assessed by comparing intervention and comparison on peer violence perpetration and victimization.","","Inclusion Criteria:# - Attending one of 20 participating schools# - In grade 9, 10, or 11# Exclusion Criteria:# - Parent submitted opt-out form"

Critical to the new strategy's success is the population-based, targeted roll-out of HIV PrEP. PrEP involves taking one pill daily of co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/ emtricitabine (FTC). This large-scale study aims for the rapid roll-out of TDF/FTC to individuals at high risk of HIV, who will comprise mostly gay and bisexual men (GBM) but will also include small numbers of heterosexuals, injecting drug users, and transgender men and women. The drug will be used according to existing NSW Ministry of Health Guidelines. By rapidly rolling out this new intervention over a 12 month period, and following participants for two years on treatments, a reduction of about 50% in new HIV diagnoses in NSW is expected.# The study aims to assess the incidence of HIV among PrEP study participants and measure the population-level impact of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on HIV diagnoses among GBM in NSW over a two-year period.# It will also evaluate the rate of PrEP uptake among high risk GBM in NSW, assess the incidence of STI (gonorrhoea, chlamydia and infectious syphilis) among people prescribed PrEP and measure the effect of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on the overall number of notifications of gonorrhoea, chlamydia and infectious syphilis in NSW, describe patterns of PrEP use and medication adherence, and monitor behavioural risk practices among PrEP users.# The main population group will be 3700 gay men at high risk of HIV infection.

This greater risk comes from many factors, some of which are related to poor emotion regulation and low self-confidence. There is a need for an HIV prevention program specifically for these at-risk teens. The goal of this study is to develop a computerized HIV prevention study tailored to adolescents in mental health treatment. The first part of the study will develop core sessions of D*STAR. It will do this by using focus group feedback from approximately 15 adolescents in mental health treatment, and approximately 10 parents of youth in mental health treatment and mental health treatment center staff. Feedback on D*STAR prototype sessions will also be collected from two individual interviews with approximately 15 youth in mental health treatment. Core sessions will then be reviewed in an open trial with approximately 30 adolescents.# The second part of the study will develop and refine digital versions of the remaining sessions of STAR and a digital general health promotion intervention. It will do this by using focus group feedback from approximately 20 adolescents in mental health treatment, and approximately 10 community advisory board members which include variety of staff from mental health treatment settings such as administrators, supervisors, therapists, health teachers at therapeutic schools, clinicians at day hospitals and day treatment programs, parents of youth in mental health treatment and from relevant community organizations, such as those serving lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth. Feedback on D*STAR prototype sessions will also be collected from two individual interviews with approximately 20 youth in mental health treatment. All developed sessions (from both Phase I and Phase II) will then be reviewed in an open trial with approximately 20 adolescents.

This is known as Low Level Viraemia (LLV). When low levels of HIV virus are present, some can mutate and make the drugs less effective (i.e. some variants of the virus become more resistant). Currently, however, these resistance mutations may be difficult to detect using standard tests for resistance because the amount of virus in the blood is very low and the standard tests aren't sensitive enough to pick up the mutations. The investigators will use more sensitive mutation detection methods, known as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), to look at whether see if there are any low levels of drug resistant HIV virus developing in the blood when LLV occurs. The investigators will look at the different treatment strategies that are used in routine standard practice when LLV is detected and evaluate which is most effective in preventing development of resistance. The investigators hope this research will help to inform guidelines on the best way to treat HIV in the future.","","Inclusion Criteria:# A subject will be eligible for inclusion in the study if ALL of the following criteria apply:# 1.

"NCT03081559","male","Improving Engagement in HIV Care for High-risk Women","Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result, TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In formative work, the investigators have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment, avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial of a theory-driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. The investigators have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV.","","Inclusion Criteria:# 1. 18+ years old; and# 2.

Current interventions that promote early identification and treatment of these diseases target a limited number of this population because they rely solely on peer education. To assess the use of the Internet as an alternative tool to reach this population the investigators propose to conduct an online randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of HIV-testing motivational videos versus standard public health text, both offered through gay websites. The methodology the investigators will use is divided in: (1) the development period, where the investigators will select gay websites for banner advertisement, create and refine effective recruitment messages and design the online survey and the video-based intervention (2) the intervention period, where participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized into a video or a standard public health text. The videos will be customized for three audiences based on self-identification: gay, non-gay and trans and will be framed within the health-belief model and the stages of change theory (3) in the outcome evaluation period we will compare the 'intentions to get tested' and 'time to HIV testing at the clinic' among MSM of each of the trial arms.

"NCT02744040","male","Modulating the Impact of Critical Events in Early HIV Infection: Effect of ART Initiation and Alcohol Use","The overall objective is to determine the influence of timing of ART initiation and alcohol consumption on HIV disease course, including detailed analysis of important events occurring shortly after HIV acquisition. ART initiation immediately after HIV infection (during Fiebig stages I-II) largely results in smaller HIV reservoir and lower HIV-associated systemic inflammation, which has been linked to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Immediate ART also reduces HIV-associated bacterial translocation and may prevent dysbiosis, an alteration of the intestinal microbiota that has been linked to increased systemic inflammation. Immediate intervention is not, however, generally feasible and more information is required about the consequences of starting ART at later time-points, but still early after acquisition. The proposed study will be conducted in Lima, Peru, in the cohort of 180 MSM with acute (Ab-, HIV RNA+) or recent (<= 3 months) HIV infection. Alcohol use disorder is present in ~50% of HIV-infected MSM in our cohort, which is four times higher than that seen among males in the general Peruvian population. Although the role of alcohol use in HIV pathogenesis and disease course remains unclear, some studies show a correlation with accelerated disease progression. In animal models and clinical studies, both acute and chronic alcohol consumption have been linked to bacterial translocation and activation of the innate immune system, which can lead to increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The effects of alcohol resemble early post-infection changes in bacterial translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by HIV and their impact on HIV disease course before and after ART initiation remain unexplored.# Specific Aim 1: To determine the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs. delayed ART initiation. The investigators will study outcomes after 1.5 and 3.5 years in MSM diagnosed with acute or recent HIV infection. The investigators will examine outcomes in 3 groups based on time of ART initiation: a) immediate: during FI-II (N~30), b) early: during FIII-V (N~50) or c) delayed: at 24 weeks after diagnosis (N~80). The investigators anticipate that CD4+ T cell counts and peripheral inflammatory markers in the FIII-V group and the delayed group will approach those in the immediate treatment group (FI-II) over time; in contrast, they expect that those started ART at ""early"" or ""delayed"" time points will have persistent changes in the GI microbiome and in the HIV reservoir.# Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of alcohol use on the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs. delayed initiation of ART. The investigators will examine the impact of alcohol use on critical events in HIV infection. They hypothesize that dose-dependent alcohol-induced changes will compound the negative effects of HIV and lead to greater levels of dysbiosis and inflammation, higher early plasma HIV RNA, and greater ""seeding"" and persistence of HIV DNA in participants with high-level alcohol use. The investigators will assess viral load, GI microbiome and metagenomics, pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of msRNA and analyze the impact on alcohol use in all subjects prior to ART initiation and among ART-adherent participants with persistent viral suppression.","","Inclusion Criteria:# - Men who have sex with men or transgender women HIV-infected with prior participation in SABES study in Lima Peru OR Established HIV infection OR HIV uninfected# Exclusion Criteria:# - counter-indication for use of study antiretroviral drugs"
